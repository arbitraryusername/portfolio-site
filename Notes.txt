Ideas for site

- Create an interactive resume, maybe a 3D resume
- Create an About page with my experience highlights, fun interests/hobbies
- Create a Projects page
- Link my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts
- Have a contact section with my email and LinkedIn
- Have a photo of me, but with cool AI generated effects/filters

Things to research:
- helmet-async
- Vite SSR
- tailwindcss

Deployment/Hosting
- look into writing scripts to deploy app to AWS 
- could create S3 bucket and set up CloudFront, OR
- could use AWS Amplify for simpler CI/CD. Connect your GitHub repo, 
   and Amplify will automatically build and deploy your app.
